    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>I am a simple showcase of a web interface for Hyperledger Fabric.</p>
    <p>It is recommended to first create a user account by navigating to <a href="/register">/register</a>.</p>
    <p>Then, using the username you have created, you can navigate to {username}/students to get a full list of students in the DB.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, you can go to {username}/students/{student_id} to retrieve a particular student from the DB.</p> <br><br>
